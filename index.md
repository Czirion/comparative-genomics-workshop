Data Carpentry’s aim is to teach researchers basic concepts, skills, and tools 
for working
with data so that they can get more done in less time, and with less pain. This workshop uses 
Data Carpentry's approach to
teach data management and analysis for genome mining research including: 
best practices for organization of bioinformatics projects and data, 
use of command-line tools to compare genetic diversity between genomes,
organize this diversity in the core and dispensable set of a pangenome,
use of command-line tools to obtain and organize biosynthetic gene clusters, 
and connecting to and using cloud computing. 
This workshop is designed to be taught over two full days of instruction.

**Please note that workshop materials for working with Comparative Genomics data are in “pre-alpha” development. 
These lessons are available for review and for informal teaching experiences, but are not yet part 
of The Carpentries’ official lesson offerings.** ❓

> ## Getting Started
>
> This lesson assumes that learners have no prior experience with the tools covered in the workshop. 
> However, learners are expected to have some familiarity with biological concepts,
> including the 
> concepts of prokariotic genome and metabolite ❓. Participants should bring their own laptops and plan to participate actively.
